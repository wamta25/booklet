A previous study demonstrated Chapel and HPX yielded best performance with respect to code complexity ratios for a 1 dimensional heat equation code. The study showed that HPX has a code complexity gap with respect to Chapel. This paper presents results of a study to close HPX's code complexity gap by way of a new source-to-source compiler called chplx. chplx converts Chapel to HPX application software. The chplx compiler creates ISO C++ application code using a new ISO C++20 library implemented using the HPX asynchronous many task (AMT) runtime system. The new ISO C++20 library closely mirrors functionality found in the Chapel programming language. The results of this study show performance and code complexity ratios between Chapel and HPX measured across 3 benchmarks and the COnstructive COst MOdel (COCOMO). The 3 benchmarks used for this study are GUPS, Streaming Triad, and a heat equation kernel. Performance is measures across 3 architectures: x86, aarch64, and risc-v (rv64g). Our performance results demonstrate chplx can maintain high performance and close the code complexity gap.
