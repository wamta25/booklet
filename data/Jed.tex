Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes memory- and type-safety, and provides a strong type system. A library or interface is considered "sound" if this safety cannot be breached without (mis)using the unsafe keyword, but safe code using sound libraries can still deadlock or yield incorrect results. We consider some representative bugs arising in parallel software development and explain in terms of invariant violation. We consider ways of addressing such bugs using Rust's type system in the context of the Rust interface for MPI as well as GPU and threaded programming paradigms with nontrivial data partitions, and give an outlook on improving the reliability and productivity of parallel software development.
