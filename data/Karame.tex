Executors in C++ abstract concurrency management across diverse hardware architectures, simplifying development by providing a consistent interface for task execution. While this abstraction facilitates portability and uniformity of the user-facing interfaces, it can also lead to performance inefficiencies by imperfectly matching the workloads or by not fully leveraging specific hardware capabilities. To mitigate this, dynamic optimizations can be incorporated into executors, enabling them to adjust their behavior based on the supplied workload, code complexity, and hardware they operate on, optimizing scheduling, resource allocation, and task distribution. We developed a chunking (workload) optimization integrated into HPXâ€™s executor API that dynamically determines optimal workload distribution and resource allocation based on runtime metrics without introducing undue overheads. Evaluated within the adjacent difference algorithm, this approach demonstrates improvements in execution time and efficiency across various configurations and workloads, offering a promising solution for improved parallel performance through a user-friendly API.
