General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is a critical operation underpinning a wide range of applications in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI). The emergence of hardware optimized for low-precision arithmetic necessitates a reevaluation of numerical algorithms to leverage mixed-precision computations, achieving improved performance and energy efficiency. This research introduces an adaptive mixed-precision GEMM framework that supports different precision formats at fine-grained tile/block levels. We utilize the PaRSEC runtime system to balance workloads across various architectures. The performance scales well on ARM CPU-based Fugaku supercomputer, Nvidia GPU-based A100 DGX, and AMD GPU-based Frontier supercomputer. This research aims to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy by bridging algorithmic advancements and hardware innovations, driving transformative progress in various applications.
