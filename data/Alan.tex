For years I was sad that not enough hard work went into making HPC much easier on the human, and much more portable. I kind of felt that there was too much chasing “machoflops” and not enough software engineering that would result in bringing more programmers to HPC. My benchmark was how many undergraduates are using HPC for interesting projects. Another observation was that it seemed infrastructure was rarely funded or encouraged.

Julia has been and is making strides in this direction, but new to the table is AI (something this tech lover turned luddite wanted to avoid always fearful this bandwagon is going to collapse and collapse hard.) I will talk about the original ongoing efforts and our SmartSolve (Funded by DARPA DIAL) project that we hope will bring everything together for HPC. Most importantly we will encourage everyone to participate; we can not do this entirely ourselves and value your contributions.
