Heterogeneous systems are ubiquitous and predicted to host more diverse architectures including quantum computing hardware. This short paper strives to design an asynchronous task-based runtime solution that can encapsulate both classical and quantum computing environments in the heterogenous execution paradigm by exploring various integration possibilities between the task-based runtime IRIS, the quantum programming framework XACC, and the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). This could be made possible by utilizing task-based kernels designed to generate optimized codes via the Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) which can then in principle be lowered to QIR. The need for asynchronous task-based execution is motivated by examples that require the co-existence of classical and quantum computing hardware. We hope to further highlight challenges that we would need to overcome to make such a solution.
