Heterogeneous systems are ubiquitous and are growing to include even more diverse paradigms, such as quantum computing. This paper strives to design an asynchronous task-based runtime solution that can encapsulate both classical and quantum computing environments in the heterogeneous execution paradigm by exploring a few integration possibilities between the task-based runtime IRIS, the quantum programming framework XACC, and the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). The need for asynchronous task-based execution is motivated by examples that require the coexistence of classical and quantum computing hardware. To show a proof-of-concept for motivating future study, we describe the principles of integrating quantum runtimes with a task-based runtime and demonstrate its capability of parallelizing quantum circuit execution by decomposing a four-qubit circuit into a collection of smaller circuits, which lowers the quantum simulation load during execution. We hope that this will further highlight challenges that we would need to overcome to make such a solution effectively scalable while simultaneously capturing classical-quantum and quantum-quantum interactions.
