Block-sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is an important operation in many scientific fields, including quantum physics and general tensor operations. Template Task Graph (TTG) is a programming model for flow graph-based composition of high-performance algorithms executable on distributed heterogeneous computer platforms. The TTG API abstracts out the details of the underlying task and data flow runtime. This paper describes the implementation of a distributed block-sparse matrix multiplication in the Template Task Graph (TTG) programming model. We will discuss the structure of the task graph and the operations involved, including strategies for controlling the distribution of matrix blocks. We further provide a performance evaluation of our implementation.
